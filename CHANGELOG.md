# Changelog

All notable changes to Quant Sentinel. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-04-27 — Logfire / Sentry / Modal wired up

End-to-end activation of the three external services that the v4 push
left as soft-stub. All three now actively shipping data:

- **Logfire**: project `antczak-j/quant-sentinel` created at
  `https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev/antczak-j/quant-sentinel`, EU region,
  credentials in `.logfire/logfire_credentials.json` (gitignored). API
  startup picks them up automatically. `POST /api/system/test-trace`
  returned `{ok: true}` and the span landed in the dashboard.
- **Sentry**: DSN in `.env` (gitignored), env report confirms
  `SENTRY_DSN: OK` at startup. `POST /api/system/test-error` raised
  the intentional ZeroDivisionError and Sentry captured it (500 in
  the API log; event in Issues).
- **Modal Labs**: token at `~/.modal.toml`, workspace `antczakj`. App
  deployed at `https://modal.com/apps/antczakj/main/deployed/quant-sentinel-train`.
  First deploy with the full ML stack (TF + Torch + transformers +
  sentence-transformers + treelite ≈ 6 GB) hit the free-tier image-build
  shutdown; trimmed `tools/modal_train.py` to what `train_all.py`
  actually imports (numpy / pandas / sklearn / xgboost / TF / scipy /
  tqdm / pydantic ≈ 2-3 GB) and the second deploy succeeded in 76 s.

#### Fixed
- `_safe_version` in `api/routers/system.py` falls back to `.VERSION`
  attr — `sentry_sdk` exposes `VERSION` (uppercase), not
  `__version__`, so /api/system/info was returning null for it.

#### Added later in the same day (after the auth flow)

After the three integrations were live, an extension batch added:

- **Cmd+K "External" group** — three palette actions (Open Logfire
  dashboard / Open Sentry Issues / Open Modal app), each just a
  `window.open()` with the right URL. Entries also bump the Recent
  ring so they show up at the top of the palette after first use.
- **Settings ExternalServicesBlock** — three sub-cards with status
  pills (`✓ ACTIVE` green when configured, else muted) and "Open
  dashboard ↗" button per service. Status comes from a new
  `/api/system/info.integrations` field that probes file presence
  beyond just env vars (Logfire credentials file, ~/.modal.toml).
- **`scripts/start.ps1`** — PowerShell wrapper for everyday DX:
  `api`, `dev`, `both`, `stop`, `status`, `restart` subcommands.
  Idempotent (checks ports first, won't double-spawn). Auto-runs
  `npm install` if frontend/node_modules is missing.
- **Logfire structured event in resolver loop** — every
  `_auto_resolve_trades` cycle ends with
  `_logfire.info("resolver.cycle.done", open_count=N,
  trades_resolved=K, spot_price=X)` so the resolver path is as
  searchable in the Logfire dashboard as the scanner side. An
  `resolver.cycle.failed` exception event covers the error path.
- **`GET /api/scanner/peek`** — read-only ad-hoc indicator
  snapshot. Computes ATR(14), RSI(14), EMA-20 distance, 14-bar
  high/low, 20-bar volatility on the latest 100 bars of any TF.
  No SMC scoring, no ML inference, no DB writes — answers "why no
  trade today?" without dropping into a shell. Settings page
  ScannerPeekBlock card with TF picker (5m/15m/30m/1h/4h),
  bias pill (bullish/bearish/neutral from EMA distance + RSI),
  and 8-tile metric grid. 30 s polling.

#### Modal pipeline — ongoing issues
- TF inside the T4 container still falls back to CPU despite
  `nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04` base + `tensorflow
  [and-cuda]`. XGBoost CUDA does work (`device='cuda'` confirmed).
  Cost overhead at weekly cadence: ~$0.50/mc wasted on T4 that's
  underused by LSTM. Tracked for next session.
- First end-to-end Modal run produced model files identical SHA1
  to local pre-train versions because the bundled `/repo/models`
  was overwriting freshly-trained weights post-run. Fixed in
  `ce63402` by excluding `models` from the image bundle.
- Local network glitch (100% packet loss to `api.modal.com` after
  laptop sleep) blocked subsequent retries — neither bug nor
  Modal-side, just ISP/router. Weekly cron will retry on its own.

### 2026-04-26 → 2026-04-27 — v4 frontend redesign + observability + ML perf push

A two-day session producing 18 commits. Frontend redesigned end-to-end,
backend gained 10 new endpoints + observability stack (Logfire + Sentry),
defensive `dynamic_params` schema closes the bug class behind `95569f7`,
Treelite ships a 12× speedup on the live-scanner XGB inference path.
Production scanner / trade resolution paths untouched throughout — every
new feature defaults OFF or is opt-in.

#### Added — Frontend (v4 redesign)
- Cursor-reactive WebGL **mesh-gradient background** via Paper Shaders
  (`MeshBackground`), lazy-loaded, disabled on `/chart` to free GPU for
  lightweight-charts. Grain noise overlay. (`2236dc5`)
- **Cmd+K command palette** (`cmdk`) — pages, symbols, recent trades,
  scanner pause/resume, grid preview/apply, grid rollback, refresh,
  reduced-motion toggle. (`2236dc5`, `9b6d9cd`, `6c292ac`)
- **Bento Dashboard** — 12-col grid with Motion `layoutId` expand-to-modal
  cards. Balance / WinRate / Recent P&L / Open / Macro / Recent signals
  / Scanner all expand to detail views. (`2236dc5`, `71a35a5`)
- **NumberFlow rolling digits** + `FlashOnChange` bull/bear pulse on
  every live numeric. (`2236dc5`, `71a35a5`)
- **AnimatedBeam** voter→ensemble→signal flow on Models page; intensity
  scales with `voter_weight × accuracy`. (`2236dc5`, `71a35a5`)
- **VoterCard expandable** with 72-h forward-move accuracy and per-voter
  retrain commands. (`9b6d9cd`)
- **Equity curve** in `BalanceDetail` (with trades-derived fallback when
  cache empty), USD/JPY 1h × 200-bar chart in MacroDetail, open-positions
  detail with 5 s polling. (`71a35a5`, `63e5bab`)
- Mini-sparklines under WR + Recent P&L bento. Magnetic buttons.
  ScrambleText brand reveal. Aurora bg. WebAudio sound feedback. (`2236dc5`)
- `?` keyboard shortcuts overlay. (`faee71f`)
- Settings widgets: SystemInfo (versions / models / GPU / disk / env /
  git short SHA), RateLimit (credit bucket bar), DbStats (table counts +
  sentinel.db file size). (`faee71f`, `8ffb7fc`, `d5c732f`)
- Cmd+K recent-actions history (last 5 in localStorage). (`30c9fbb`)
- HealthDeepPopover replaces the static live/down pill — click for
  per-subsystem status (DB / models / GPU / scanner / trades).
  (`379fc99`)
- React `ErrorBoundary` around routes — render exceptions show a
  recoverable fallback instead of a blank screen. (this release)

#### Added — Backend endpoints
- `POST /api/scanner/{pause,resume}` + `GET /api/scanner/status` — surface
  the file-flag mechanism. (`71a35a5`)
- `GET /api/models/ensemble-weights` reads voter weights from
  `dynamic_params`. (`71a35a5`)
- `GET /api/portfolio/history` reconstructs from `trades` when cache empty.
  (`71a35a5`)
- `GET /api/params/{usage,drifts}` — live writer/reader counters + drift
  detector for `dynamic_params`. (`e0ccc66`)
- `GET /api/grid/{list,preview,apply,backups,rollback}` — surfaces
  `apply_grid_winner.py` over HTTP, `confirm:true` required for writes,
  path-traversal-safe rollback. (`9b6d9cd`)
- `GET /api/system/{info,db-stats,rate-limit,health/deep}` + `POST
  /api/system/{test-trace,test-error}` for observability smoke tests
  and Settings widgets. (`faee71f`, `8ffb7fc`, `d5c732f`, `30c9fbb`)

#### Added — Observability + defense
- **Logfire** OTEL platform (auto FastAPI + httpx instrumentation, custom
  scanner spans). Soft-disabled without `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`. (`67ecd77`)
- **Sentry** — error capture + slow-tx + cron heartbeat
  (`monitor_slug=bg-scanner`). Soft-disabled without `SENTRY_DSN`.
  (`9b6d9cd`, `6c292ac`)
- **Slow-request middleware** — logs WARN above `SLOW_REQUEST_MS`
  (default 500 ms). (`8ffb7fc`)
- **`dynamic_params` Pydantic-style schema** with auto-mirror
  `target_rr → tp_to_sl_ratio` (closes bug class `95569f7`), 30-min drift
  watchdog, schema-aware `set_param` / `get_param`. (`e0ccc66`, `faee71f`)
- Startup env-vars OK/missing report in `logs/api.log`. (`6c292ac`)

#### Added — ML / performance
- **Treelite-compiled XGB voter** (`tools/compile_xgb_treelite.py`) — ~12×
  speedup on N=1 single-sample inference (the actual scanner case).
  Parity max abs diff 5.96e-08 vs native. Load priority: Treelite →
  ONNX/DirectML → sklearn. (`d972d3f`)
- **DuckDB warehouse reader** (opt-in `QUANT_USE_DUCKDB=1`). Empirical
  bench: pandas wins 2.5× on single files, DuckDB wins 4× on multi-file
  SQL aggregations. 8/8 parity tests. (`e9488c8`)
- **Polars groundwork** — 16/16 features pass parity (≤3.6e-12 EWM, ≤3.3e-16
  elsewhere). `compute_features` itself stays pandas. (`6c292ac`, `faee71f`)
- **Optuna optimizer** (`scripts/run_optuna_optimization.py`) — TPE +
  median pruner, SQLite study storage, `--mock` evaluator. (`6c292ac`)
- **Modal Labs skeleton** for off-loading `train_all.py`. (`6c292ac`)

#### Added — Build
- Migrated to **`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`** (199 packages); back-compat
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` still works. `requires-python ≥ 3.12`.
  (`58566f8`)

#### Fixed
- Hero price + KPI digits invisible under `text-display-gradient` /
  `text-gold-gradient` (cascading `-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent`
  bled into NumberFlow). Switched numeric values to solid colors.
  (`5029fdf`)
- `TracedConnectionProxy` breaks `Connection.backup()` — disabled
  Logfire's sqlite3 instrumentation. (`67ecd77`)
- uv `prerelease=allow` (global) picked dev wheels for unrelated packages;
  switched to `if-necessary`. (`e9488c8`)

#### Tests
40 unit tests across three suites:
- `tests/test_dynamic_params_schema.py` — 19 (mirror, drift, edge cases).
- `tests/test_grid_endpoints.py` — 13 (TestClient, path traversal,
  confirm-required, 404 handling).
- `tests/test_warehouse_duckdb_parity.py` — 8 (pandas vs DuckDB parity).

#### Tooling
- `tools/bench_warehouse_reader.py`, `tools/compile_xgb_treelite.py`,
  `tools/polars_features_parity.py`, `tools/modal_train.py`,
  `scripts/run_optuna_optimization.py`.

### 2026-04-13 — Autonomous overnight retrain session

**Net production change**: LSTM voter resurrected. Other voters unchanged.

#### Added
- `tune_lstm.py` — Optuna sweep for LSTM with 14-dim search space including
  target redesign axis (`target_type`, `target_horizon`, `target_atr_mult`).
  Two-gate winner selection: `balanced_acc >= 0.52 AND live_stdev >= 0.03`.
- `retrain_deeptrans_loop.py` — strict-gated retrain loop for the deep
  transformer voter (3-class softmax, balanced_accuracy + live_stdev gates).
- Backup safety net: `models/_backup_<TS>/` dir + git tag
  `pre-autonomous-overnight-<TS>` snapshotting all artefacts + DB params
  before any production-touching change.

#### Changed
- `models/lstm.{keras,onnx,scaler.pkl}` **promoted from sweep winner**
  (trial #38: balanced_acc 0.547, live_stdev 0.0336 → 0.4593 post-retrain
  on train+val merge). `ensemble_weight_lstm` restored 0.0 → 0.15
  (conservative; previous self-learned 0.25 was on the flat-output era model).
- `run_production_backtest.py::_reset_backtest_db` — now truncates
  `trades / scanner_signals / ml_predictions` tables instead of unlinking
  the SQLite file. The unlink path raised `WinError 32 'used by another
  process'` while the module-level `src.core.database._conn` held the file
  open, AND closing that conn broke any `NewsDB` instances that had
  cached `self.conn`. Truncate is locally race-free.

#### Tried but not promoted (see `logs/autonomous_morning_report.md`)
- DQN sweep (8 of 60 trials, early-stopped). Trial 8 won val at +14.99%
  but `--apply-winner`'s held-out test reproduced only +0.06%; eval_compare
  vs production confirmed mode collapse (1 trade vs prod's 547).
  Production DQN retained (live attribution showed it as 82%-accuracy
  voter — still the best of the basket).
- DeepTrans retrain (4 iterations). All flat on live (stdev 0.005-0.011),
  best val_bal 0.391 < 0.42 floor. Voter stays disabled
  (`QUANT_ENABLE_TRANSFORMER` unset).

#### Known limitations (acknowledged, not fixed this session)
- `ml_predictions.trade_id` remains historically NULL on most rows. The
  scanner.py:921 UPDATE that links predictions to trades runs inside a
  silent `try/except: pass` and has been failing silently long before
  this session. Worked around by `/api/models/voter-attribution`'s
  timestamp-join. Fix would touch hot live code path — deferred.

### Added — Backtest infrastructure (P0-P8)
- **Production backtest harness** (`run_production_backtest.py`): walk-forward
  through historical data using the REAL scanner pipeline (SMC + ML ensemble +
  risk manager). 3-layer isolation from production DB (`data/backtest.db`,
  env var enforcement, paranoid runtime guards).
- **Historical data provider** (`src/backtest/historical_provider.py`): yfinance
  replay with proper time-slicing, disk cache (6h TTL), SMC cache invalidation
  on each tick.
- **Execution realism** (P6): commission, vol-scaled slippage, overnight swap
  cost, gap detection with worse-fill penalty.
- **Position management**: next-bar-open entry (no look-ahead), trailing stops
  (1R→BE, 1.5R→lock, 2R→trail), optional partial close at 1R (`--partial-close`),
  BREAKEVEN status for trail-to-entry exits.
- **Advanced analytics** (`src/backtest/analytics.py`): Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar,
  expectancy, rolling WR/PF, drawdown recovery time, time-of-day/DOW heatmap,
  P&L skewness/kurtosis.
- **Statistical methodology**: walk-forward windows (`--walk-forward N`),
  Monte Carlo bootstrap (`--monte-carlo N`), buy-and-hold benchmark with
  `alpha_vs_bh_pct`.
- **Tooling**: `--strict` for production-parity thresholds, `--compare`
  side-by-side diff, `--seed` for determinism, `--export-csv`, `--plot-equity`,
  `--resume` checkpoint recovery, `--analytics` full report.
- **Parameter sweep** (`run_backtest_grid.py`): systematic grid over
  min_confidence × sl_atr_mult × target_rr, ranked by Sharpe.
- **Frontend dashboard**: `BacktestResults` component on ModelsPage reads
  `/api/backtest/runs` + `/api/backtest/latest` + `/api/backtest/chart` +
  `/api/backtest/run?name=X` endpoints. Shows metrics card, equity curve PNG,
  Monte Carlo p5/p50/p95 distribution, rejection histogram, compare dialog.
- **Documentation**: `docs/BACKTEST.md` full CLI + metrics interpretation reference.
- **Tests**: 38 new tests (isolation, historical provider, e2e analytics).

### Added — RL training overhaul
- **Prioritized Experience Replay** (SumTree) with bootstrap stratification.
- **Multi-asset training** with `vol_normalize=True` fixing critical
  `balance += pnl × entry_price` bug (forex was invisible, BTC dominated).
- **Validation early stopping** (`VAL_PATIENCE=30`) + best-weight restoration.
- **Noise augmentation** (NOISE_STD=0.001) + checkpoint resume with data hash.
- **Training registry** (`src/ml/training_registry.py`): append-only JSONL
  log with git commit, hyperparams, per-symbol metrics.
- **Eval tooling**: `eval_rl.py` with model comparison, `regenerate_rl_onnx.py`
  standalone helper.
- **New model**: retrained 4-asset basket (GC/EURUSD/ES/CL) with vol_normalize
  → **+14pp OOS improvement** over pre-session gold baseline.

### Added — Observability (Phase 1)
- Scanner health metrics: `scan_duration` histogram, `scan_errors_total`,
  `scan_last_ts`, `data_fetch_failures`, `signals_long/short/wait`.
- Ensemble instrumentation: `ensemble_confidence` histogram + signal counters.
- `/api/health/scanner` endpoint with `healthy/stale/degraded/no_data` status.
- `/api/health/models` endpoint with staleness detection (14-day threshold).
- `/api/training/history` endpoint + `TrainingHistory` frontend widget.
- Database indexes: `idx_ml_pred_timestamp` (COVERING, 4.7k-row table),
  `idx_ml_pred_trade_id`, `idx_rejected_filter`.
- `verify_install.py` post-deploy smoke check (8 automated checks).

### Added — Defense (Phase 2)
- **Event guard**: `@requires_clear_calendar` decorator blocks trades 15 min
  before high-impact USD events (NFP/CPI/Fed).
- **Volatility targeting**: position size scales inversely with ATR
  (baseline/current ratio, clamped [0.4, 1.8]).
- **Volatility-aware slippage**: spread scales with current ATR × session.

### Added — Iteration tools (Phase 3)
- Training registry JSONL (`models/training_history.jsonl`).
- Backtest harness with pluggable strategies (SMA/RSI/ensemble).
- Per-model track record (`model_*_correct/incorrect` counters).
- Ensemble confidence tracking in metrics.

### Added — Code quality (Phase 4)
- Type hints pass on config.py, compute.py, new files.
- ESLint 8 → 9 migration with flat config (`eslint.config.js`).
- Tests: `test_rl_agent.py` (17), `test_event_guard.py` (8),
  `test_backtest_isolation.py` (16), `test_historical_provider.py` (10),
  `test_backtest_e2e.py` (13), `test_backtest_harness.py` (9).

### Changed
- **Scanner cadence 15min → 5min** (4× more trade opportunities, credit
  budget 1.6/min avg of 55/min limit).
- **`@vitejs/plugin-react` 4 → 6**, **`lucide-react` 0.383 → 1.8**,
  **`eslint` 8 → 9**, **`TypeScript` 5.3 → 5.9**, **`tailwindcss` 3 → 4**
  (flat config, `@theme` in CSS, Lightning CSS autoprefix).
- **DQN ensemble weight** 0.20 → 0.12 (conservative default, let
  self-learning adjust based on live track record).
- **Event guard integration** centralized via decorator.

### Fixed
- **Critical**: backtest trades were never resolved — `db.log_trade()` used
  wall-clock `datetime.now()` instead of simulated time.
- **Critical**: SMC cache (60s TTL) not invalidated between backtest ticks,
  making all cycles return identical analysis.
- **Critical**: `TradingEnv.balance += pnl * entry_price` broke multi-asset
  training (BTC at $60k dominated forex at $1.05). Fixed via `vol_normalize`.
- **Critical**: in production, `QUANT_BACKTEST_RELAX` shell-env leak could
  activate relaxed filters. Fixed via double-gate (`MODE + RELAX` both
  required) + production entry points explicitly clearing flags.
- `self_learning.py:113` undefined `stats` (should be `tw_stats`).
- `self_learning.py` session comparison: used capitalized strings against
  DB's lowercase `db.get_session()` output. Now uses same helper.
- `add_wavelet_features`: "buffer source array is read-only" via
  `df['close'].to_numpy(copy=True)`.
- `UnicodeEncodeError` in `DQNAgent.load()` on Windows cp1252 console.
- `calculate_position(td_api_key)` unused parameter marked deprecated,
  defaulted to empty string.
- Implicit Optional in `compute.py` ONNX conversion helpers.
- `macro_data.Myfxbook` login spam downgraded to debug in backtest mode.
- `vite-plugin-pwa` peer-dep workaround via `package.json overrides`
  (removed `.npmrc legacy-peer-deps` hack).

### Removed
- `frontend/.npmrc` (replaced by `package.json overrides`).
- `frontend/postcss.config.js`, `frontend/tailwind.config.js`
  (Tailwind 4 uses CSS `@theme`).
- `frontend/.eslintrc.json`, `frontend/.eslintignore` (ESLint 9 flat config).
- `autoprefixer` dependency (Lightning CSS built-in).

### Security
- Production hardening: `api/main.py` and `src/main.py` explicitly clear
  `QUANT_BACKTEST_MODE` + `QUANT_BACKTEST_RELAX` env vars at startup with
  warning if present.
- Backtest isolation: `BacktestIsolationError` raised if `DATABASE_URL`
  resolves to `data/sentinel.db` at enforce time.
