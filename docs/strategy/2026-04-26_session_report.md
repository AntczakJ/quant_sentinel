## Four major findings

### 1. Asymmetry FLIPPED post-B1-B5

Old asymmetry memo (2026-04-25) was based on data BEFORE B1-B5 defenses landed. With those defenses live, the picture inverted:
- LONG: WR 60% / pnl ≈ −$14 (roughly neutral)
- SHORT: WR 10% / pnl −$208 (real bleed in current XAU bull)

Old memo flagged stale; new memo `asymmetry_flip_2026-04-26.md`.

### 2. B1-B4 LONG penalties were over-tuned

Softening B1 (−15→−7) + B4 (−25→−10) unlocked 5x more trades (20→98). Per-direction analysis: LONG approached break-even (49% WR / pnl −$183 over 86 trades) while SHORT stayed broken. Confirms that B1-B4 was cutting working trades.

### 3. SHORT in `macro_regime=zielony` is the bleed

Adding B7 (−20 SHORT in bull regime) effectively eliminates SHORT trades in current data (3 slip through, all losses). LONG-only in bull regime is the operative configuration.

### 4. Variable lot sizing was inverse-correlated with outcome (BIGGEST BUG)

Per-trade analysis of `short_block_traoff`:
- Winners avg lot **0.026**
- Losers avg lot **0.084 (3.2× bigger)**

Source: A+ grade `risk_percent × 1.5` (2% cap) plus Kelly compounding amplified position size on "high confidence" setups — but those setups lose more. The system literally bet against its own predictions.

Validated by equal-lot run (PF 1.80, +7.18%) and flat-risk-combo (PF 2.14, +7.43% with -3.02% DD). Per-grade multiplier removed in `c217ad9`. MAX_LOT_CAP=0.01 in .env as safety floor until full rebuild.

## What's now in production

`.env` (gitignored):
```
DISABLE_TRAILING=1
MAX_LOT_CAP=0.01
```

Code (committed):
- `smc_engine.py` — B1, B4 softened; B7 added
- `finance.py` — per-grade `risk_percent` multiplier removed; MAX_LOT_CAP env var honored; QUANT_RISK_LONG/SHORT_MULT env vars
- `api/main.py` — DISABLE_TRAILING gate in resolver; streak threshold 5→8
- `run_production_backtest.py` — BACKTEST_TIME_EXIT_*, BACKTEST_EQUAL_LOT, --warehouse flag
- `src/backtest/historical_provider.py` — `from_warehouse()` classmethod

## Phase 1 warehouse status

Pre-existed from prior session — 9 symbols × multiple TFs, including 3 years XAU 5m (231,464 bars). Tonight added:
- `HistoricalProvider.from_warehouse()` for 0-API-call backtests
- `--warehouse` flag in `run_production_backtest.py`
- 90-day warehouse backtest started; result pending

## Phase 2 status

Pre-existed: triple-barrier + r-multiple + binary label modules; v2 XGB + LSTM trained for both directions on 231k samples.

Validated on 50k bars: triple-barrier TP rate is 26% baseline. Binary >0.5 ATR labels are 60-70% positive (tautological). See `memory/label_baseline_2026-04-26.md`.

Implication: trading edge lives in scanner filters, not raw price action. WR 26% baseline → 46-47% filtered = 1.8x lift.

## Frontend v3 (commit `fcc412d`)

Rebuilt from scratch. Old preserved at `frontend_v1/`.

- **Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript strict + Vite + Tailwind + react-query + framer-motion + lightweight-charts
- **Design tokens**: ink-{0..900}, gold-{400..600}, Apple typographic scale (display-xl 96px → micro 11px)
- **5 pages**: Dashboard, Chart, Trades, Models, Settings
- **Build**: 545 kB JS / 19 kB CSS (gzip 177 / 4)
- **Dev**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` → http://127.0.0.1:5173
- **Vite proxies** `/api/*` → `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/*` (no CORS needed)
- **Offline banner** shows when API health check fails

## Known caveats

1. **Sample size remains small.** 30-day backtest is 50-70 trades. PF 2.14 has wide error bars. The 90-day warehouse backtest result (when it finishes) will be more meaningful — ~150-200 trades.
2. **Variable-lot bug only patched, not fixed.** MAX_LOT_CAP=0.01 + per-grade-mult removal are stop-gaps. Real fix needs Kelly state validation + lot logic redesign.
3. **API not running.** 4 trades remain OPEN in `data/sentinel.db`. User should restart API after reviewing tonight's commits + .env config.
4. **Live data needed.** XAU reopens Sun 21:00 UTC (already past). 24-72h live observation is the natural next step — verify B7 fires on macro=zielony, MAX_LOT_CAP=0.01 holds, DISABLE_TRAILING doesn't break the resolver.

## Recommended next session — top 3

1. **Wait for warehouse_90d result.** Will be in `reports/2026-04-26/warehouse_90d.json` when complete (~19:10 CEST today). Compare PF to flat_risk_combo. If it stays >1.5, ship the config to live.
2. **Validate live behavior 24-72h.** Restart API with new .env. Watch dashboard for filtered LONG trades, verify lots cap at 0.01, verify no SHORT trades in zielony regime. Critical eye on whether B7 over-blocks.
3. **Rebuild lot-sizing logic properly.** Drop MAX_LOT_CAP cap once a sensible Kelly + grade-aware system replaces the inverse-correlated one. Either: (a) constant 0.5% risk regardless of grade, (b) cap A+ at 1.0× until validated, (c) fully model-driven from triple-barrier R-multiple predictions.
